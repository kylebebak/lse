## other scripts

### lse (list executables)
an alternate version of the bash built-in `which`, with some extra bells and whistles

### usage
```
-h            get help (display this page)
-a            list files in every directory in path. after -a, all other options are passed directly to ls, not lse
-l            list all directories in path, without any files
-p            list executables with their full path, one per line
```
